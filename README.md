### 1. Manacher's algorithm
> Manacherâ€™s algorithm is used to find the longest palindromic substring in a given string and was discovered by Glenn K. Manacher in 1975.

Given that there is no middle or centered element in an even-length string and that the subroutine of the algorithm literally searches for the longest palindrome centered at index "i," the aforementioned properties only apply to odd-length palindromes. As a result, the string is preprocessed by inserting or stuffing a specific character before and after each character of the input string.
